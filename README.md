# Image Search App

## Overview

Image Search App is a powerful and easy-to-use application built using React. It allows users to search for and display images sourced from the expansive Unsplash API. With a sleek and straightforward interface, this app provides a seamless user experience for finding and viewing images.

## Features

- **Image Search**: The heart of this application is its search functionality. Users can enter any search term into the search bar, and the application fetches corresponding images from Unsplash.
- **Data Fetching**: The application fetches data in real-time from the Unsplash API using Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, known for its easy-to-use API and ability to handle concurrent requests.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: This app makes full use of React's component-based architecture, making the code more manageable and the app more performant. It effectively passes image results from the parent component (App) to a child component for display.
